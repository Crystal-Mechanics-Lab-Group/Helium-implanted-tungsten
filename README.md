# -Helium-implanted-tungsten
Dataset from CPFE, Laue diffraction and AFM for pure and helium-implanted tungsten
The folder includes dataset for helium-implanted tungsten and pure tungsten. The data includes measurement of the following for both materials  as observed experimentally, and predicted using crystal-plasticity simulations:

1. Surface morphology of nano-indents, 

2. Lattice-distortions around and under nano-indents

3. Computed geometrically necessary dislocations field around and under nano-indents in both materials

4. Load-displacement curves

Guidelines for using dataset:

1. Extracting the folder will generate five individual folders

2. In the AFM plots folder, use the matlab code and dataset in the the folder to generate the surface morphology of nano-indents.

3. In the "CPFE implanted sample data" folder --> use "CPFE implanted matlab code" --> load "variables2" --> run the code (raw data is also provided in the folder)

4. In the "CPFE unimplanted sample data" folder --> use "CPFE unimp matlab code" --> load "variables3" --> run the code (raw data is also provided in the folder)

5. In the "Laue unimplanted data" folder --> use matlab code with relevant raw data provided in folder

6. In the "Laue implanted data" folder --> use matlab code with relevant raw data provided in folder

7. Excel sheet provides nano-indentation and CPFE predictions of load-displacement curves
